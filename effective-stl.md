# Effective STL
## Containers
- Item 1. Choose your containers with care
- Item 2. Beware the illusion of container-independent code
- Item 3. Make copying cheap and correct for objects in containers
- Item 4. Call empty instead of checking `size()` against zero.
- Item 5. Prefer range member functions to their single-element counterparts
- Item 6. Be alert for C++'s most vexing parse
- Item 7. When using containers of newed pointers, remember to delete the pointers before the container is destroyed.
- Item 8. Never create containers of auto_ptrs.
- Item 9. Choose carefully among erasing options
- Item 10. Be aware of allocator conventions and restrictions.
- Item 11. Understand the legitimate uses of custom allocators
- Item 12. Have realistic expectations about the thread safety of STL containers.

## Vector and string
- Item 13. Prefer vector and string to dynamically allocated arrays
- Item 14. Use `reserve` to avoid unnecessary reallocations
- Item 15. Be aware of variations in string implementations.
- Item 16. Know how to pass vector and string data to legacy APIs.
- Item 17. Use "the swap trick" to trim excess capacity
- Item 18. Avoid using `vector<bool>`.

## Associative Containers
- Item 19. Understand the difference between equality and equivalence
- Item 20. Specify comparison types for associative containers of pointers.
- Item 21. Always have comparison functions return false for equal values.
- Item 22. Avoid in-place key modification in set and multiset.
- Item 23. Consider replacing associative containers with sorted vectors.
- Item 24. Choose carefully between `map::operator[]` and map-insert when efficiency is important.
- Item 25. Familiarize yourself with the nonstandard hashed containers

## Iterators
- Item 26. Prefer `iterator` to `const iterator`, `reverse_iterator`, and `const_reverse_iterator`.
- Item 27. Use `distance` and `advance` to convert a container's `const_iterators` to `iterators`
- Item 28. Understand how to use a reverse_iterator's base iterator
- Item 29. Consider `istreambuf_iterators` for character-by-character input

## Algorithms
- Item 30. Make sure destination ranges are big enough
- Item 31. Know your sorting options.
- Item 32. Follow remove-like algorithms by erase if you really want to remove something
- Item 33. Be wary of remove-like algorithms on containers of pointers.
- Item 34. Note which algorithms expect sorted ranges.
- Item 35. Implement simple case-insensitive string comparisons via mismatch or lexicographical compare
- Item 36. Understand the proper implementation of copy_if
- Item 37. Use accumulate or for_each to summarize ranges.

## Functors, Functor Classes, Functions, etc.
- Item 38. Design functor classes for pass-by-value.
- Item 39. Make predicates pure functions.
- Item 40. Make functor classes adaptable.
- Item 41. Understand the reasons for `ptr_fun`, `mem_fun`, and `mem_fun_ref`
- Item 42. Make sure `less<T>` means `operator<`

## Programming with the STL
- Item 43. Prefer algorithm calls to hand-written loops.
- Item 44. Prefer member functions to algorithms with the same names
- Item 45. Distinguish among `count`, `find`, `binary search`, `lower_bound`, `upper_bound`, and `equal_range`.
- Item 46. Consider function objects instead of functions as algorithm parameters
- Item 47. Avoid producing write-only code.
- Item 48. Always `#include` the proper headers
- Item 49. Learn to decipher STL-related compiler diagnostics
- Item 50. Familiarize yourself with STL-related web sites
